IOS simple demo for tfsc public chain

According to the sdk-rpc source code provided by the [TFSC official GitHub](https://github.com/tfs-labs/sdk-rpc), it is implanted into the ios project.

I wrote a simple demo, which includes creating an account, restoring an account, obtaining balance, and transferring funds.

The node program I mentioned is the TFSC official version that supports internal testing RPC interface. If you plan to use this demo, please make sure that the node program you are using is version v0.22.x or later.
